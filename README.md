# HSE | Master Thesis | Decentralized Approaches for Geospatial Data Exchange using Web Technologies

## ‚úç  Description

The topic of my master thesis is ‚ÄúDecentralized Approaches for Geospatial Data Exchange using Web Technologies‚Äù. 

During my research I proved that the integration of the modern decentralized Web protocols to the existing centralized GIS systems reduces time for downloading spatial data in multiple use cases, decreases workload of the existing centralized GIS Web services and  generates perspectives for the next generation of the GIS systems based on peer-to-peer decentralized Web protocols.
